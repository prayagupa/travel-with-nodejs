* How do you create a instance of an injector for dependency injection in Angular 2?
* With DI application becomes more flexible for changes. Support this statement.
* @Injectable() is a mandatory decorator used for  a Service class. (YES/NO)
* What is a service provider?
* Dependency instance in Angular 2 is an application wide singleton. (YES/NO)
* Registering provider in the root module is the only way to scope a service to become application wide.
* What are dependency injection tokens? What is OpaqueToken?
* How can you make a dependency optional?
* Apart from services, we also need dependency injection in our components and directives. 
But we never used @injectable() for our component. Why?
